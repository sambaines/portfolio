			<p>This is the year I start to push on and make things happen for myself. This is the initial draft.</p>
			<p>I've set new goals this year to hopefully get me to a place I want to be by year end; goals about writing, coding, product building, reading and health. I'm not going to be able
			to complete them all, but let's give it a go. One of the main goals is to push my career further and that starts with having an up-to-date portfolio and home on the web.</p>
			<p>To this end I am following the trend of live iteration and going to design and build this in the wild: there will be mistakes. Stylesheets are going to go awry, designs aren't going to be
			pixel perfect but it's a start. Inspiration for this came from <a href="https://destroytoday.com/">Jonnie Hallman</a> and his recent blogging and building. I'm also going to use this
			as a massive learning curve for a whole host of things from design to privacy focus products (looking at you <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>) to writing.</p>
			<p>The theory I am following for the layout and focus is from this Dann Petty video:</p>

			<br />
			<p>'Hey What About Me?' - let's see how this unfolds over the next few weeks. I'm planning one post a week this year (so I am already behind) but by the end 52 posts is the goal.</p>
